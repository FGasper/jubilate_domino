# Jubilate Domino

## Non-binding, unofficial guidelines for music in Catholic parishes.

# Introduction

The following is a distillation thoughts from a particular group of
experienced liturgical musicians concerning interpretation of the
rubrics for music in the Mass of the Roman Rite. As laypersons, we
do not presume to offer an interpretation that merits any claim
to canonical authenticity or authority; however, in the spirit of
collegiality with our fellow musicians and of filial devotion to our
clergy, the following thoughts are offered in the interest of
fostering deeper and more fruitful discernment concerning the planning
and execution of Roman liturgical music.

# General Principles

The General Instruction of the Roman Missal states:

    40. … in the choosing of the parts actually to be sung, preference is to be given to those that are of greater importance and especially to those which are to be sung by the Priest or the Deacon or a reader, with the people replying, or by the Priest and people together.

This is an eminently practical principle: the parts that GIRM 40 prioritizes
for singing are generally the parts that do not change from week to week and
are thus easy to learn and to sing week to week.
This is in essential continuity with the three-tiered hierarchies that
/Musicam sacram/ (1967) and /De musica sacra et sacra liturgia/ (1958)
describe in greater detail.

# Musical Style and Instrumentation

GIRM states:

    41. The main place should be given, all things being equal, to Gregorian chant, as being proper to the Roman Liturgy. Other kinds of sacred music, in particular polyphony, are in no way excluded, provided that they correspond to the spirit of the liturgical action and that they foster the participation of all the faithful.

The specific interpretation of this and corresponding passages in
/Sacrosanctam Concilium/ has been the subject of much debate since the 1960s.
While much more could be said, it seems safe to assert here that a parish that
makes no regular use of Gregorian Chant—or that relegates the chant solely to
a particular season—has abandoned the spirit of the above passage of
GIRM, even if no juridical norms are in violation per se.

A musical repertoire that is uniquely proper to the Roman Liturgy is one that
liturgical musicians should know well. Ignorance of the chant or unfamiliarity
with it should thus be considered deficiencies in such musicians.

Much has been said about the diversity of other musical styles in
Roman liturgy today. On this topic a few observations are offered here:

1. Congregational music should normally be uncomplicated and easy to learn.
As a general rule, a melody that cannot easily be sung without accompaniment,
without a conductor, or without substantial rehearsal time is not
well-written for a congregation.

2. Certain more difficult melodies that bear
the weight of tradition, such as
the Mass settings in the Kyriale or hymns like /Veni Creator Spíritus/,
merit the time required to learn them and should still be taught.

3. A congregation and a choir may be thought of as two different
“instruments”, each with distinct characteristics that suggest different
musical characteristics. Music that is idiomatic for one may not fit
the other well. The sublime beauty that a group of rehearsed,
practised singers can create requires different music from the “joyful
noise” of an enthusiastically singing congregation.

Closely connected to the question of musical style is that of instrumentation.
The organ has a sustaining quality that matches that of the human voice in a
way that instruments that are struck or plucked do not. The organ also allows
a wealth of timbres and scope of volume that other instruments cannot provide.
These qualities make the organ uniquely well-suited both to accompanying
singing and to being a solo instrument in its own right.
For these reasons, as a matter of simple practicality, the organ’s close
association with the Roman liturgy is
one that parishes should proudly maintain, prizing the organ above all
other instruments in liturgical use.

# The Role of the Choir

GIRM states:

    103. Among the faithful, the schola cantorum or choir exercises its own liturgical function, its place being to take care that the parts proper to it, in keeping with the different genres of chant, are properly carried out and to foster the active participation of the faithful by means of the singing.

Here GIRM establishes the choir’s two-fold purpose: to sing its own
chants as well as to foster the congregation’s participation—which
presumably here means to encourage their singing. A choir that does not
sing its own distinct liturgical part (e.g., chant propers or motets) thus
fails to fulfill its true purpose, as does a choir that does not sing with
the congregation.

# The Choice of Language

GIRM 41 establishes a desire that the faithful “know how to sing together at
least some parts of the Ordinary of the Mass in Latin, especially the
Profession of Faith and the Lord’s Prayer, according to the simpler
settings.”

Many of the same considerations apply to the question of Latin as with
Gregorian chant. Much debate has occurred concerning Latin’s proper role
in the reformed Liturgy. At a minimum, it is safe to assert that parishes
that make no regular use of Latin—or that relegate it solely to a particular
season—are denying the desires that GIRM 41 establishes.

In particular, insofar as CIC 249 requires that seminarians be “well-versed”
in Latin, it seems reasonable to state that they should also be
competent to recite the Mass in that language.

# The Different Parts of Mass

## Entrance

The widespread practice of singing a congregational hymn here is not the
only option that GIRM permits at this point in the Mass;
indeed, the Roman Church’s ancient
repertoire of Introit chants envisions singing by the choir alone.
These chants are a significant part of the Roman liturgical tradition,
and parishes with choirs that are capable of singing them should consider
this as a laudable option.

It is notable also that this part of the Mass does not meet GIRM 40’s
criteria for meriting priority in the choosing of parts of the Mass to sing.

## Greeting of the People

This falls under the category of “Priest … with the people replying” from
GIRM 40 and thus should be given priority for singing.

## Penitential Act and Kyrie Eleison

The /Confiteor/ meets GIRM 40’s criteria; however, the absence of a melody
for this text in the Missal suggests that this text is not normally to be
sung. The other parts, however, of this part of the Mass do have melodies
and meet GIRM 40’s criteria; therefore, they should be sung.

## Gloria

GIRM establishes no preference for whether this text should be sung by the
choir, congregation, or in alternation. The general practice of
congregational singing here, however, is laudable and fitting given the
relative ease of the settings from the /Kyriale/.

At occasional Masses (e.g., weddings) where the congregation is unlikely
to sing or to gather again, we suggest that the Gloria be sung by the
choir alone.

## Collect and Response

This meets GIRM 40’s criteria and thus should be prioritized for singing.
TODO: Insert link to settings.

## The Readings

The readings may be sung according to the melodies given in the Gradual
or the Missal; however, this should only be done when the lector is
comfortable doing so and can preserve intelligibility of the text.

## The Responsorial Psalm or Gradual

The normal practice of a cantor leading the singing of a psalm is
laudable; however, particularly in parishes where such is not feasible,
the psalm may also be sung by the entire congregation without intervening
responses.

The Graduals from the /Roman Gradual/ envision singing by a choir or even
one or two cantors; thus, they do not meet GIRM’s criteria for proper
execution of this part of the Mass. Nevertheless, their presence in the
liturgical books suggests that in some cases they may be appropriate.

In particular, a Gradual sung by a choir or cantors may work well at an
occasional Mass (e.g., a
funeral or wedding) where the congregation is unlikely to sing and will
not foreseeably gather again.

## The Acclamation before the Gospel

The same general considerations apply here as with the Responsorial Psalm.

As with the Graduals, while GIRM appears effectively to exclude the
Gregorian Alleluias from the Roman Gradual, their presence in the
liturgical books suggests that in some cases they may be appropriate.
The aforementioned case of a “one-time” congregation that will not sing
a responsorial Alleluia may pertain.

## The Profession of Faith

This meets GIRM 40’s criteria and should thus be prioritized for singing.
It is lamentable that this is not standard practice. GIRM allows singing
either by all together or by the people in alternation with the choir; the
centuries-old tradition of choral singing here is effectively excluded.

Note also that GIRM 41 cites this text by name as a desirable one for
the faithful to be able to sing together in Latin. This suggests a
desirability of regular use of Latin here.

## The Universal Prayer

This meets GIRM 40’s criteria and should thus be prioritized for singing
if a suitable cantor is available, subject to the same criteria as
for the readings. The Missal provides several melodies.

## The Preparation of the Gifts

The same considerations apply here as at the Entrance. This part of the
Mass is not prioritized for singing as per GIRM 40.

## The Prayer over the Offerings

This meets GIRM 40’s criteria and should thus be prioritized for singing.

## The Preface Dialogue

This meets GIRM 40’s criteria and should thus be prioritized for singing.

## The Sanctus

GIRM establishes the recitation of this text as the province of the
priest and people together. At face value, this effectively excludes the
centuries-old tradition of choral singing of the /Sanctus/.

This document makes no comment on the claim by some that other liturgical
legislation justifies choral singing of the Sanctus in the Ordinary Form.

## The Canon

Those priests who are capable of singing this text clearly should
do so, especially on Sundays and other solemn occasions. The same
considerations apply as for the readings.

## The Anamnesis (Memorial Acclamation)

Because this text is a response to the priest’s invitation, the priest
should ideally sing that invitation in the same musical key as the
congregation’s response.

It is notable that this short text has more of the character
of a response than a longer text like the /Sanctus/ or /Agnus Dei/; thus,
there is little purpose to instrumental accompaniment here.

It is suggested that parishes adopt a single version of this text
so that the faithful can confidently respond to the celebrant’s
prompt without a need for the celebrant to recite the response with
them.

## The Amen

The Missal offers no justification for (nor proscription of) the
widespread practice of repeating the congregation’s “Amen” at the end
of the Canon.

## The Lord’s Prayer

This meets GIRM 40’s criteria and should thus be prioritized for singing.

Note also that GIRM 41 cites this text by name as a desirable one for
the faithful to be able to sing together in Latin. This suggests a
desirability of regular use of Latin here.

## The Agnus Dei

GIRM says that this text is “usually” sung responsorially; this does
not exclude full recitation by either the congregation (e.g., the
settings in the /Kyriale/) or the choir alone.

## Communion

The same essential criteria apply here as at the Offertory and Entrance:
this is not a part of the Mass that GIRM prioritizes for singing, and that
singing may be done by the choir alone or by the choir or cantor with the
people.

Choral singing is particularly advantageous at this time because of the
amount of physical activity that is typical among the congregation. Most
untrained singers—and even some trained ones!—are uncomfortable singing
while moving.

The English translation of GIRM 86 effectively proscribes choral singing
by stipulating that there by unity of communicants’ voices; however, this
passage is a mistranslation of the Latin, which makes no mention of whose
voices are in unity. Read in this proper light, the understanding becomes
that the unity of the choir members’ voices is an expression of the
communicants’ spiritual union.

## Post-Communion

GIRM’s allowance for a “Psalm or other canticle of praise” to be sung by
the whole congregation is a laudable option.

The priest’s prayer and its response meet GIRM 40’s criteria and are
thus to be prioritized for singing.

## Concluding Rites

This meets GIRM 40’s criteria and should thus be prioritized for singing.

## “Recessional” Hymn

This laudable practice is not required but enjoys widespread use.
